Project Name: Portfolio Website

Description: This website that I'm making is a practice for me to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
At the same time, I can make use of it to showcase other works of mine and I hope to be able to improve myself in web development and other aspects of programming.



List of features planned to incorporate:
Add audio to website.
Full width header and footer.
Anchored header.

More to come...
